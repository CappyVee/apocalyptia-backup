1. TITLE SCENE



2. INTRO SCENE
  Your thoughts, your dreams...

  All sight and sound meld into a thick slurry of memory.  As if someone had taken cement dust and injected it into your cranium.

  It is quiet.

  You awake to the sharp panic of having forgotten something important.

  Something very important.



3. GAMEPLAY SCENES:
  3.1 CRYO SCENE
  There are large tubes, resembling phone booths flooded with gelatinous mouth wash.   The room is oddly warm.  The <span class="interactable">door</span> looks as though it has not been opened in some time.  Maybe the <span class="interactable">terminal</span> to the left can be of assistance.

  A <span class="interactable">screwdriver</span> sits on the lone metal table, but there is no dust present.  How long had you been asleep?

  Where are you?



4. END
