### INTRODUCTION

In the year 20XX, war was begin. You were a member of an elite science squad working in an underground government facility. When the bombs went off, you were escorted to a cryo-stasis chamber to wait for the fallout to dissipate.

Now, an unknown number of years later, your cryo pod hisses open and you awaken alone in an unfamiliar location.

Knowing that the world outside your current prison is likely a mutant-infested hellscape, you think it might be a good idea to scavenge what supplies you can while looking for a way out. Pro-tip: Keep an eye out for any supplies (i.e. edible foodstuffs) or weapons that may aid you in your upcoming trek across the wasteland.
